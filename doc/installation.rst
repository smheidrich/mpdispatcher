Installation
============

Via pip
-------

To install the latest version directly from the repository:

.. code:: bash

  pip install git+https://gitlab.com/smheidrich/mpdispatcher.git


Source code
-----------

The source repository can be found
`on GitLab <https://gitlab.com/smheidrich/mpdispatcher/>`_.
There is also a `GitHub mirror <https://github.com/smheidrich/mpdispatcher>`_,
but I much prefer GitLab so all development happens there.
